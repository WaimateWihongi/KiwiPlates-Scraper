# KiwiPlates-Scraper
I wrote a quick Python script to scrape KiwiPlates for the shortest license plates available. The script displays the available plates and saves them to a text file.

## How to use
Ensure you have Python 3 & pip installed and configured correctly.

* Install the requirements listed in the text file using the following command in the project folder.
> pip install -r requirements.txt

* Run the *main.py* file.

## Notes
The default save location for the plates is a plates.txt file inside the project folder.
